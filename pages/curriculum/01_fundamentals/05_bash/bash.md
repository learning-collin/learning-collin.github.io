## Background 
Bash is a Unix command language, used as the default login shell
(or command-line interpreter) for most Linux distros. Bash processes commands
in a text window and can also execute commands from a file (a 'shell script'). 
Although you may never need to be a bash wizard, having a working relationship
with the language is a prerequisite to becoming an effective developer. Bash is
not necessarily a replacement for GUI tools, but in many cases it is much more
useful (indeed, it can be the only available tool) for a given application.

The linux command line can seem complex and scary at first. Trust me that it
will quickly seem intuitive and simple; once you grasp some basic concepts, you
will be able to use the shell effectively and continue learning on your own.

Although this lesson only briefly touches on more complex tools, it is worth
familiarizing yourself with `sed`, `grep`, `awk`, and other standard bash
tools.
